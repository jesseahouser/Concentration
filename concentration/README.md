Fork and clone the git repository, type `npm install` while in the directory you cloned your repo in, then type `npm start`! Have fun!
### GAME LOGIC
Looking for a match:
Reveal one card
Reveal a second card
If it is a match, keep those cards static (can't flip over)
If it is not a match, flip them over so their backs are shown!

We'll add scoring, once we get around to it!
